# assets

These assets are from [Monsters Time Fantasy RPG Asset Pack][asset-pack]. That means that they are **paid** assets subject
to a [license]. Please purchase your own copy of the assets if you want to use them for projects beyond learning game
development with this tutorial.

In other words, I (unintentionally) included assets in this tutorial that need to be paid for. Please support the creator
of those assets by buying their work. They also have a large selection of [free assets] that they provide for both free
and commercial works. We need people like this who provide great art for the game development community. The only way
that is sustainable is if we support them!
