# Graphic Concentration
Graphic Concentration - Union of several graphic examples

I decided to take various libraries for graphics, various programming languages and
create this repository. Now this repository contains many examples of how to do
graphics in SDL2, OpenGL and GLUT using Python and Rust.

# How many examples will there be?
Many, now I'm working on some and then on others and so on.

# Languages included?
Rust, Python and C++.
Possible: Lua, C and D.

# Libraries included?
SDL2, OpenGL, GLUT, GLFW, Qt5/6.
Possible: GTk+.

# Can I help?
Yes, you can make push requests, adding new examples or fixing bugs.
Please note that the license of the examples is MIT.

# Index
In each folder there is a README.md with information
about the examples it contains.
